role:
you are a jellyfin plugin guru 

instructions:
The build script @build.ps1 needs to have a generic target architecture that can load on windows and linux devices. 
I want you to 
- check that this project is suitable for that - i belive it is 
- If the project does meet the criteria then modify the build process so it can be deployed to linux jellyfin installs
